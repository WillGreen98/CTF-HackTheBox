# CTF-HackTheBox

My solutions to: [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu "HackTheBox's Homepage")

## Info

This repo is for me to keep track of progress / passwords. I plan to password protect any files that will openly spoil the CTF (Game). I shall include password ```password-placeholder``` if you want to check or validate the next box.

I am new to CTF's so this is a learning opportunity; after every section I will leave a write-up PDF/ MD file.
